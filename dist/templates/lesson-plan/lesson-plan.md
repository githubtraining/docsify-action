## Lesson Objectives <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

> [!WARNING|iconVisibility:hidden|label: Students should be able to complete tasks related to the objectives in each section]

<!--
Lesson objectives list what students will be able to do after completing the lesson.

When creating lesson objectives, it's important to consider the following:

It’s important to start with an action that relates to what students should be able to do after the lesson
These objectives let you easily tell if your lesson has effectively taught your students new concepts and skills.
It can feel overwhelming to pin down specific takeaways for a lesson, but you can break the process into steps
It’s best to view your lesson objectives as goals for your class and students.
Use the "SMART" criteria when creating lesson objectives:
Is the objective specific?
Is the objective measurable?
Is the objective attainable by all students?
Is the objective relevant to your class and students?
Is the objective time-based to align with your syllabus?
-->

Introductory objectives

- <!--objective 1 -->
- <!--objective 2 -->

Extended objectives

- <!--objective 1 -->
- <!--objective 2 -->

## Prerequisites <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!--
Prerequisites are requirements or knowledge that the LEARNER needs to have prior to this lesson

When listing out prerequisites, consider the following:

Prerequisites should only include the absolute necessary requirements a learner needs to be successful in this lesson's outcomes
If possible, provide links to additional information for each prerequisite

## Lesson Procedure <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!--
Your lesson procedure is an in-depth explanation (step-by-step plan) of how the lesson will progress

When writing your lesson procedure, you need to choose the type of activities that will help your learners meet the lesson objectives.

To do that, consider the following:

How will you introduce the topic?
What’s the best way to teach this information
How can you incorporate problem solving and critical thinking?
What real-life scenarios relate to this topic?
Does this topic lend itself to group work?
How does remote vs in-person delivery affect your teaching?
In general, consider the following when creating a lesson procedure strategy:

Explore: Learners discover a concept
Learn & Practice: Learners apply their discoveries
Reflect & Reinforce: Learners review what they’ve learned and apply their knowledge to problem-solving scenarios
 -->

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Explore**

<!--
In the Explore phase of your lesson, you’ll introduce the objectives of the lesson and discuss key concepts learners should know.

Below are some examples:

Icebreaker activity to get learners thinking about the new concept
Show the "soufflé" to get learners excited about what they're create
Examine/introduce real-world examples to demonstrate benefits of the topic
-->

**Discussion topics**:

- <!-- topic 1 -->
- <!-- topic 2 -->
- <!-- topic 3 -->

**Discussion Activity**:

- Purpose: - <!-- What is the purpose of your activity -->
- Activity overview:
  - <!-- Activity step 1 -->
  - <!-- Activity step 2 -->
  - <!-- Activity step 3 -->
  - Reflect on the pros and cons of the examples.

#### **Learn & Practice**

<!--
In the Learn & Practice phase, learners will demonstrate application and hands-on skills practice.

This phase will make up the bulk of your lesson time, so be sure to detail everything out in your lesson procedure!

Below are some common steps and details to consider:

Group/individual work
Hands-on activites
Make sure to include any alternate steps specific to delivery methods:

Remote
In-person
 -->

**Discussion topics**:

- <!-- topic 1 -->
- <!-- topic 2 -->
- <!-- topic 3 -->

**Hands-on activity 1**:

- Purpose: - <!-- What is the purpose of your activity -->
- Activity overview:
  - <!-- Activity step 1 -->
  - <!-- Activity step 2 -->
  - <!-- Activity step 3 -->
  - Reflect on the pros and cons of the examples.

#### **Reflect & Reinforce**

<!--
In the Reflect phase, learners will look back (and reflect on) what they’ve learned in the lesson and apply what they’ve learned through critical thinking activities..

Often, facilitarors will lead a class discussion with critical thinking questions for learners to answer. It's important to list the questions you plan to ask within the lesson procedure to make sure you don't forget anything.

During the learn and practice phase of your lesson procedure, what do you want the learners to modify based on the group or individual reflection after the practice application? Do you want students to complete the same tasks with new knowledge, complete separate tasks, or engage in a group discussion?

This phase should include any activities, questions, or discussions to help reflect and reinforce on the topic(s) in your lesson procedure.

## Assessments <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!--
The assessment method measures whether the learners the targeted information and met your lesson objectives.

There are several ways to measure learning through formative assessments. Some common assessment options include:

Assessment questions
Hands-on activities
Group presentations
Consider the following:

If an objective was related to understanding a concept, consider an assessment that requires learners to explain that concept.
If an objective was for learners to demonstrate a skill, design an assessment to confirm they can do that skill.
Is there any post-class homework to complete as recommended additional learning?
 -->

To assess the learner's understanding, provide each learner with a repository based off the template repository prepared as part of the lesson materials. The learner must perform the following tasks in the repo to complete the assessment:

1. <!-- Objective to assess -->
   - <!-- Task to assess the objective -->
   - <!-- Example: Commit a code change to a repository -->
1. <!-- Objective to assess -->
   - <!-- Task to assess the objective -->
   - <!-- Example: Download a package from GitHub Packages -->

Grading and feedback of activity:

- Did the learner complete the steps as expected?
- Even if the learner had missteps in the activity, did the repo end up in the expected state?
